Our project is a website where people can play fantasy sports. Fantasy sports is a game that allows players to create a virtual sports team by picking their favorite athletes regardless of the athletes’ teams in real life. Players then join other players to form groups and compete for the most points. A player gains points according to the performance of their athletes in real games. Within a group, an athlete may not be on two different fantasy teams. This is why a pick phase is required to set up groups. Although not a core feature of our project, in fantasy sports players are able to trade and drop athletes. Another extra feature is displaying an athlete’s statistics for the current season. A group session ends when the sport’s season ends and the player with the most points in the group wins.
